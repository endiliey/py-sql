Assume s is a string of lower case characters.

Write a program that prints the number of times the string 'bob' 
occurs in s. For example, if s = 'azcbobobegghakl', then your
program should print
Number of times bob occurs is: 2

"""
s = 'azcbobobegghakl'

count = 0
for 'bob' in s:
    count += 1
print("Number of times bob occurs is: " + str(count))
